# An App about Nothing
Tim and I couldn't make it to NYC for the Seinfeld 30th Anniversary celebration
and scavenger hunt, so I brought the scavenger hunt to Tim.

# Because we live in a society, here's how to get started:
To start the application, run:

    % ./bin/setup


To run the tests, run:

    % bundle exec rspec
